# MIPLab project
This repository contains the code for my project on the topic of: *Brain simulations to investigate functional plasticity in subjects with agenesis of the corpus callosum.*
This project took place in the spring semester from February to June 2020 and then continued as my master thesis from September 2020 to January 2021.
